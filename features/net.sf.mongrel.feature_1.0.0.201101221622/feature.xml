      Mongrel is an Eclipse plugin for running Tomcat (including the ability to debug
      Tomcat applications, or Tomcat itself) from within Eclipse. This is basically
      the former Sysdeo Tomcat Launchner Plugin, with added support for Tomcat 7. As
      the Sysdeo plugin seems to be no longer supported (at least, I received no
      response for several mails over the last years) and the original code was
      available under the BSD license, I grabbed the existing stuff and created an
      ASL 2.0 licensed project on SourceForge.net, which I intend to maintain, at
      least for my own purposes.
